# Refund by location Smart Contract Implementation

## Introduction
Smart contracts are a way to create and run applications on the blockchain. In this project, we will implement a smart contract that allows users to request a refund by location.

## Objectives
The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee’s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.  
If, at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.  

## Requirements
The project requires the following:
Node.JS
